### Project Files
All project files are organized in the `hardware` folder. If you'd like to manufacture an identical board, the Gerber files necessary for production are available in the `hardware/fab` folder.

Please note that the board does not need to be assembled exactly as shown in the photo. You are free to assemble only the components you want or need, tailoring it to your specific requirements.

Because of this flexibility, the project does not include a complete bill of materials (BOM). Please refer to the notes in the schematic diagram for more detailed information.

Below is an example of an assembled board featuring common black connectors:

### Project Background:
Almost 20 years ago, I purchased a commercial prototype board with multiple connectors that greatly facilitated my work. Unfortunately, I no longer remember where I bought it, and I am unsure if it is still being manufactured. This inspired me to create my own version, customized to meet my specific needs.

The board (circa 2008):
